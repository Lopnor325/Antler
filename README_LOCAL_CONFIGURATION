Basically you should be able to open project and run tests without any additional configurations,
except: 

*)projects with tests for [<ORM> + SqlServer]. In these projects you may need to specify valid connection
strings to Sql Server in corresponded app.config files.

*)to run tests over MongoDb you need to download MongoDb BINs and put them into the tools/MongoDb/bin folder. Then
start MongoDb instance using tools/MongoDb/start.cmd file.

If you have any problems, just let me know.
