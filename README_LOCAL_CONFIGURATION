Basically you should be able to open project and run tests without any additional configurations,
except: 

*)projects with tests for [<ORM> + SqlServer]. In these projects you may need to specify valid connection
strings to Sql Server in corresponded app.config files.

*)to run tests over MongoDb you need to download MongoDb BINs and put them into the tools/MongoDb/bin folder. Then
start MongoDb instance using tools/MongoDb/start.cmd file.

*)your test-runner(NUnit, Resharper) should load assemblies with tests into different AppDomains, because there are many integration tests around
that need to be properly isolated. E.g. for Resharper you could find this option in settings.

If you have any problems, just let me know.
